### A Unique Experience

[Code For Greensboro](http://codeforgreensboro.org/) is our local [Code For America](http://www.codeforamerica.org/) brigade.  Code For
America is a volunteer organization focused on helping municipal governments make better decisions and provide citizens with useful
services through the use of technology.  I joined Code For Greensboro in July and have since been to several 'hacknights' and have 
helped planned 'Civicon 2015', the annual hackathon competition.  I urge anyone, technical or not, to check out your local Code For 
America brigade and see how you can help.
