### A Unique Experience

[Code For Greensboro](http://codeforgreensboro.org/) is our local [Code For America](http://www.codeforamerica.org/) brigade.  Code For
America is a volunteer organization focused on helping municipal governments make better decisions and provide citizens with useful
services through the use of technology.  I joined Code For Greensboro in July and have since been to several 'hacknights' and have 
helped plan 'Civicon 2015', the annual hackathon competition.  I urge anyone, technical or not, to check out your local Code For 
America brigade and see how you can help.

To check out my contributions to the group so far, check out [Findit.](https://github.com/codeforgso/findit) Findit aims to be
a mobile-ready web application citizens of Greensboro can use to find public facilities and services.  We're using Reactjs and Leafletjs for the UI and our brigade's OpenDataSoft Portal on the backend.  It's been a great learning experience and I 
can't wait for it to be complete!
