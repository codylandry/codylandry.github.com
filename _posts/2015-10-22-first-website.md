## Humble Beginnings

Thanks for visiting my first *non-tutorial* type website.  I've always considered myself a 'backend guy', but this experience has shown me that front-end development can be a lot of fun. I created this site based on the <a href="http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/" target="_blank">Agency bootstrap theme by startbootstrap.com.</a> 

I chose to host my site on github because it has so much going for it, especially for a personal site.  I can freely use my own domain. Github uses <a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com" target="_blank">jekyll</a> to host its free sites.  The downside is that you can't use any server side scripting languages like php, but you *can* host jekyll blog sites.  

What you're reading now, I wrote using <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/" target="_blank">PyCharm</a> on my mac.  Posting to my blog and making site content edits or css changes is as easy as:

    git commit -m 'added awesome blog post!'
    git push origin master
    
*or in my case, command-k enter in PyCharm*
    
I've found that this is an awesome combination.  I have total control over how my site appears and have a free easy solution to getting up for the world to see.  Not to mention, <a href="http://www.github.com/codylandry" target="_blank">*all my code*</a> is freely available for potential employers to see.
