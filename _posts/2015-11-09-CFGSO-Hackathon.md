## Civicon 2015

This weekend Code For Greensboro hosted their fall hackathon, named '[Civicon 2015](http://hackathon.codeforgreensboro.org/).' 
It was truly a great weekend.  We had some fantastic speakers including City of Greensboro CIO Jane Nickles and Red Hat
Community Manager Jason Hibbets.  At the kickoff party Friday night, Jane announced that Greensboro
was voted the 2015 Digital City of the Year by the Center For Digital Government.  Jane also announced the 
release of the city's new [open data portal](https://data.greensboro-nc.gov/) with datasets ready for us 
to build applications to benefit the community.  We had nine teams of hackers enter the competition.  Teams 
had from Friday at 7pm to Sunday at 1pm to build an application using the data provided and present it to an
esteemed panel of judges. The prizes were $1000, $500 and $250 for first, second and third place respectively.

### We did it for the fun and the experience.

I was on a team named 'The Flying Turtles'.  My team had not previously met before Friday. It was a college student named Sophia,
a data analyst named Leonard and me. We all wanted to participate, but didn't have a team already, so we decided make 
one on the spot.  By Sunday, we had built a native mobile app and [responsive website](https://github.com/sophiathach/violationsapp) that helps potential residents determine 
if a neighborhood is suitable for their family before moving.  We used the LOE case data from the city's portal 
along with jquery and leafletjs to build the site.  Leonard didn't have any previous coding experience and managed to create a 
native app using [appinventor](http://www.appinventor.org/).  All the teams built some amazing apps with some great ideas. 
While sitting in the auditoreum waiting on the judges announcement of the winners, we were making bets on which of the other
teams had won.  Then, Jane came out and announced the third and second place winners.  At this point we though we knew who had won,
then she said...

# The Flying Turtles!

We were *blown* away. It turns out that our idea coupled with our enthusiasm and spirit were exactly the combination the judges
were looking for.  Jane commented on how important LOE data is to the city and that initiatives were already being put into place
to utilize this data more effectively and that we were right on track.  They also said that by using simple common technologies,
that our app was more extensible and wanted us to integrate more datasets to truly make it Greensboro's goto site for choosing
a place to live for families.  This was an amazing experience. I am so glad to have found this group and can't wait to see what
we can build in the future!
